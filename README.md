<h2>Hi.</h2>
<p>I'm Grace. Please call me Moon/ Avery online. I don't mind you calling me Gracie, just don't do it online(and preferably don't spell it Gracey). I'm 13, a Dragon, a Libra. My birthday is on October 9th. Top student(prob). I like Science. Especially Chemisty. Its very interesting. I'm also the creator of The Traveller's Journey (TTJ), my OC base. I really like purple - most of the time. I like it if it is light purple ONLY.</p>
<p>I want to make a game for TTJ if I get help</p>
<p>I also like sketching, and dont mind digital drawing(not photoshop)</p>
<p>I know how to use phython, html and css. A bit of js also, but im still learning(its very hard). I feel like canva is harder to make pretty tho.</p>
<p>I'm good at math but i dont really like it. Trilingual(eng, ind, mand). I dont like ind. Its so hard.</p>
<p>I can make beverages! its very gud! :D (i quit matcha)</p>
