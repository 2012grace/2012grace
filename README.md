<h1>Hi.</h1>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm Grace. Please call me Moon/Avery online. I don't mind you calling me Gracie, just don't do it online(and preferably don't spell it Gracey). I'm 13, a Dragon, a Libra. My birthday is on October 9th. Top student(prob). I like Science. Especially Chemisty. It's very interesting. I'm also the creator of The Traveller's Journey (TTJ), my OC base. I really like purple color - most of the time. I like it if it is light purple ONLY.</p>
<h5>More About Me!</h5>
<p>I want to make a game for TTJ if I get help</p>
<p>I also like sketching, and don't mind digital drawing(not photoshop)</p>
<p>I know how to use phython, html and css. A bit of js also, but i'm still learning(it's very hard). I feel like canva is harder to make pretty tho.</p>
<p>I'm good at Math but I don't really like it. I can speak trilingual(Eng, Ind, Mand). I don't like Ind. It's so hard.</p>
<p>I can make gud beverages!! :D (I quit make matcha)</p>
